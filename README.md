# Trivia-Game
This is a trivia game made with Javascript and the jQuery library as an assignment for the UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp. In this assignment I specifically focused on dynamically generating and removing elements, as well as creating Javascript timer events to progress the game automatically.

The simple, responsive user interface is composed primarily with the Bootstrap CSS library and CSS keyframe animations sourced from Animista.
